            <div className="legal-body">
                <p>This Privacy Policy describes the policies and procedures of Raven Protocol (“we,” “our,” or “us”) pertaining to the collection, use, and disclosure of your information on https://raven.market/ and related applications and products we offer (the “Services” or “Raven Protocol”).</p>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>Your right to privacy and the protection of your personal data is important to us. The following sections provide further details as to how we process your personal information through Raven Protocol. We don't share your information with third parties except to deliver you our Services and products, comply with the law, make Raven Protocol better, protect our rights, or effectuate a business transfer. If you have any questions or concerns about this policy, please reach out to us at contact@raven.market. Unless indicated otherwise, this Privacy Policy does not apply to third party products or services or the practices of companies that we do not own or control, including other companies you might interact with on or through our services. Raven Protocol operates as a non-custodial platform that enables users to participate in decentralized financial products, including yield, liquidity, and restaking services across supported blockchain networks. Raven does not store, manage, or control private keys, wallet balances, or user funds. We do not store, manage, or control private keys, wallet balances, or transactions conducted through the blockchain. Any transactions conducted using Raven Protocol are recorded on public blockchain networks, which operate independently of us. Your privacy and security while interacting with these networks are determined by their protocols, and Raven Protocol has no control over how blockchain data be processed or stored.</p>

                <h2>How do you accept this policy</h2>
                <p>By using Raven Protocol, including downloading one of our applications or visiting our website, you agree to the use, disclosure, and procedures outlined in this Privacy Policy.</p>

                <h2>What information is covered under this policy</h2>
                <p>This Privacy Policy covers your personal information. Personal information is information or an opinion, whether true or not, and whether recorded in a material form or not, about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable. All personal information received in connection with our business is subject to strict rules of confidentiality.</p>
                <p>Common examples may include your name, username, password, IP address, unique device identifiers, gender, signature, address, telephone number, email, date of birth, bank account and digital wallet details, billing and credit or debit card details, photos and videos of you, other identification credentials and biographical details, and commentary or opinions about you.</p>

                <h2>How personal information is collected</h2>
                <p>"Personal information" is data that identifies, relates to, describes, can be used to contact, or could reasonably be linked directly or indirectly to you. For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, there is no meaningful distinction between the terms "personal information" and "personal data".</p>
                <p>You may choose not to provide some of the personal information described above. Please note, however, that some of our services require some personal information to operate, so if you choose not to provide the personal information necessary to operate and provide you with a particular service or feature of that service, you may not be able to use that Service or feature.</p>

                <h2>Information that you give us</h2>
                <p>We may collect your personal information directly from our contact with you. This may include by you completing forms or parts of our website, Social Media, and/or other software and/or mobile applications, by you providing us with consent to access personal information such as photographs, videos or photo albums, by you providing us with consent to access the microphone and/or camera on your device, or by you contacting us via the email, telephone, through Social Media and other similar functions either directly through our website or through third party host websites, in person, through various marketing channels or competitions either directly through our website or through third party host websites, and surveys.</p>
                <p>You understand that any personal information that you provide to us must be accurate and up to date. We will assume this to be the case.</p>

                <h2>Information that we collect about you</h2>
                <p>In this Privacy Policy, "Social Media" means social media networking sites of any kind or nature including but not limited to web or internet based or mobile telephonic devices or medium such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn, which enable the creation and exchange of user generated content.</p>
                <p>Our website, Social Media, and/or other software and/or mobile applications may automatically collect the following information about you each time you visit or otherwise use our website, Social Media, and/or other software and/or mobile applications:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>We use technologies like cookies, log files, and web beacons to collect this information. These tools help we and our service providers recognise your device, manage authentication, remember preferences, personalise experiences, manage advertising, and conduct data analytics.</p>

                <h2>Sensitive information</h2>
                <p>Throughout the course of collecting your personal information, we may collect sensitive information about you. Sensitive information includes:</p>

                </ul>
                <p>If we do collect any of your sensitive information, we will only collect this information with your consent and for reasons that are reasonably necessary or otherwise related to the provision of our services in accordance with applicable privacy laws and principles.</p>
                <p>Where you consent to our collection of your sensitive information, you also consent to us using that sensitive information for the purpose/s for which it was collected, including its disclosure to third parties.</p>

                <h2>How we use the information we gather</h2>

                    <li>where we collect or disclose information that is or relates to the Internet Protocol Address used to connect your device to the internet, for the purpose of fraud detection and management of the integrity of the services. This may include detecting when users who engage in illegal activities or breach our Terms of Use;</li>
                    <li>where information is or relates to system version information of your device, or the make and model of your device, for the purpose of our compatibility assessments with our software versions and other aspects of our services;</li>
                    <li>using your personal information to provide you with information that you have requested from us, although we do not create a link between your user ID and your user email;</li>

                    <li>managing our relationships with you and our other customers.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We may aggregate public blockchain data (e.g., transaction details, wallet interactions) for analytical purposes. This aggregated data is not personally identifiable and is used to enhance our Services, detect patterns, and prevent fraud.</p>

                <h2>How do we share your personal data with third parties</h2>
                <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business and we are not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others. We may transfer personal data to our service providers or third parties in connection with Raven Protocol's operation of its business, as certain features on Raven Protocol rely on various third-party products and services (collectively “Third Party Services”).</p>
                <p>These third party services providers only have access to certain personal information, such as your public wallet addresses, to perform their functions and may not use it for other purposes. Furthermore, they must process the personal information in accordance with our contractual agreements and only as permitted by applicable data protections laws. Business transfers: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing privacy notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that Raven Protocol or substantially all of its assets are acquired, users' information will be one of the transferred assets. We may share non-personally identifiable information publicly and with our partners- like publishers, advertisers, developers, or right holders.</p>

                <h2>Legal obligations to disclose</h2>
                <p>We may be required to disclose your personal information for the purposes for which it was collected and also subject to our legal obligations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>as required by law;</li>
                    <li>to any person where necessary or desirable in connection with our provision of services; and</li>
                    <li>on a confidential basis to our external service providers and advisors.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To be clear, you consent to our disclosure of your personal information to any of our business partners, suppliers, subcontractors or the like, advertisers and other advertising networks, analytics and search engine providers and other third parties provided the disclosure of your personal information is for the purpose or ancillary to the services that we or these third parties offer you and for the purposes the information was originally collected.</p>
                <p>We may share your information with other third party business partners for their own marketing purposes. These third parties include online advertisers or ad tech companies, who may provide you with targeted advertising and marketing communications, where permitted under law. The information we share includes information collected through your use of our services and information we collect about you through the use of cookies and similar technologies.</p>
                <p>You understand that we are authorised to disclose your personal information to third parties if we buy or sell any business or assets, including our business, if we are under a duty to disclose your information, or if the disclosure of your personal information is necessary for us to conduct an investigation into any unlawful activity that we know or suspect has or may be engaged in.</p>

                <h2>Your rights with respect to the processing of personal data</h2>
                <p>Through our website, Social Media, and/or other software and/or mobile applications, we provide services to users throughout the world. As we process personal information of data subjects inside the European Economic Area (“EEA”), we are bound by Regulation (EU) 2016/679, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>

                <p>We recognise the below rights which you enjoy under the applicable data protection law with respect to your personal data:</p>

                    <li>Right to rectification: If your personal data stored by us is inaccurate or incomplete, you have the right to demand at any time that we correct the information.</li>
                    <li>Right to erasure: You have the right to demand that we erase your personal data if and to the extent that the data is no longer needed for the purposes for which it was collected or if the data is processed on the basis of your consent and you have opted to revoke your consent. In such cases, we must cease processing your personal data and remove that data from our IT systems and databases.</li>
                    <li>The data may not be deleted due to a statutory obligation or must be processed due to a statutory obligation.</li>
                    <li>The processing of data is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li>
                    <li>Right to restriction of processing: You have the right to demand that we restrict the processing of your personal data.</li>
                    <li>Right to data portability: You have the right to receive the personal data that you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format. You also have the right to request that we transmit this data to another controller, where technically feasible. This right applies only if the processing is based on your consent or a contract and is carried out by automated means.</li>
                    <li>Right in relation to automated decision-making and profiling: You have the right not to be subject to a decision based solely on automated processing, including profiling, which produces legal effects concerning you or similarly significantly affects you.

                    <li>Right to object to processing: If your data is processed by us on the basis of Article 6(1)(f) GDPR, you may object at any time to processing by us.

                    <li>Right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority: Pursuant to Article 77 GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a data protection supervisory authority if you believe that the processing of your personal data infringes data protection law.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Complaints</h2>
                <p>If you are concerned about a possible interference with your privacy or about the potential misuse of your personal information, please contact us at the above email address.</p>

                <h2>Data retention</h2>
                <p>We will only keep your information for as long as reasonably necessary to fulfill the purposes for which your personal information was originally collected.</p>
                <p>We will delete your information after a reasonable time. You may be required to re-enter your personal information if it has been deleted.</p>
                <p>You agree and acknowledge that we use third party servers to store and process data. As such, your personal information may be stored at on servers based around the world, including in North America, Europe or Asia, or transferred within any of these jurisdictions, or a destination outside of these jurisdictions. This will allow our staff (whether employed by us or by a third party engaged by us or otherwise authorised under this Privacy Policy to access your personal information) to process your information for the purposes of providing you with our services.</p>
                <p>If you disconnect your Wallet from Raven Protocol, stop using the platform, or request that your information be deleted, we may still retain some personal information to maintain Raven Protocol or to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements.</p>

                <h2>Data security</h2>
                <p>We are committed to ensuring that your personal information is protected in accordance with applicable laws and our data privacy policies. We use a combination of physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect your information during transmission and storage.</p>
                <p>We may rely on third-party vendors to facilitate certain aspects of our Services, including blockchain network access. While we carefully select these vendors, we do not control these third parties or the blockchain networks they interact with. As a result, we cannot guarantee the complete security or functionality of their services.</p>
                <p>Despite our efforts to secure your personal information, no system is entirely immune to risks, including unauthorised access, disclosure, alteration, or deletion due to events such as hardware or software failures, malicious attacks, or other unforeseen circumstances. Any information you provide to us or interact with on the blockchain is done so entirely at your own risk.</p>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>We are especially sensitive about children’s information. Our Services are not targeted towards children, and our users must be at least eighteen (18) years old to use our services. We don’t knowingly collect information from children under the age of 13. If you are a parent or legal guardian of a minor child, we will treat any information that you provide us while using Raven Protocol on behalf of your minor child as Personal Information as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy. If you have questions concerning our information practices with respect to children, or if you learn that a child under the age of 13 has used Raven Protocol, created a user account, or provided us with personal information, please email us at contact@raven.market.</p>
